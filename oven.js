//Write appropriate functions here for the oven. You may want to consider the following:
//1. A restart button is created when the user clicks the stop button.
//2. Now that you have created a restart button, think of what should happen when the restart button is clicked (refer back to the demo to help you).
//3. If you encountered any bugs in the demo, this is also the place where you can improve the demo's code.
//4. Some functions that you may find useful: getElementById, removeChild, innerHTML, setAttribute, appendChild, insertBefore.
